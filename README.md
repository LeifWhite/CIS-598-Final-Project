# CIS-598-Final-Project
CIS-598 Final Project

This program is a python based standard chess engine made by Leif White for my senior design class CIS-598.  For this program to work optimally, you should also download the Syzygy 5 piece tablebase and the ProDeo292 opening database.

Current time log: Approximately 90 hours of prior work


Plans for future improvements:


1. Create user interface

    a. Create playing tool with custom time controls

    b. Create board editor tool

    c. Create analysis board tool

2. Modify programming language to allow faster processing

3. Improve endgame evaluation

4. Create bot account on online chess website to estimate Elo rating

5. Have engine query more opening books

6. Give notion of move percentage completion

7. Program concept of time controls and adaptability to less time

8. If mate is found, donâ€™t look further on any other move order
